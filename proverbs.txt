Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Actions speak louder than words.


Monkey see, monkey do.
The more the merrier.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
It's not over till it's over.
There's a sucker born every minute.
There's more than one way to skin a cat.
There is no accounting for tastes.
There's no fool like an old fool.
There is no honor among thieves.
There's no place like home.
There's no time like the present.
They don't make things like they used to.
Time heals all wounds.
To err is human, to forgive, divine.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Truth is stranger than fiction.
Turnabout is fair play.
Two heads are better than one.
Two's company, three's a crowd.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
